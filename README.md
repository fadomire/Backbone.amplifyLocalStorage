# Backbone amplifyLocalStorage Adapter v0.0.1

Fork of jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage that uses Amplify Store for IE5, 6, 7 compatibility

This fork works exactly the same way as original regarding usage. It only replace HTML5 localStorage with Amplify.store

See AmplifyJs page for more infos.

Of course include amplify.js in your imported script before Backbone.localStorage.

All original tests included and passing.
